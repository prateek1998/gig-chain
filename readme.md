Please develop the web-app Frontend (FE) and Backend (BE) for the below two screens using MERN Stack (i.e. using React for the FE and Node for the BE (APIs)): -
1) Gig Allocation tab 
2) Tracking tab  

Stretch goal (for additional marks): develop the "map view" screen of the "Tracking tab" including integration with Google Maps APIs to display the map on the page. "map view" screen will appear as an overlay (modal) on top of the "Tracking" page.

Complete it and share the code (as zip file or on github) and host the web-app on render.com (free hosting provider) and share the link with me.

Timeline: 3 days.

Once you have gone through the designs let me know if you have any queries... We will have a call (over Google-Meet) to discuss the UI interactions and to answer your queries...
